************************THIS IS THE README FOR ADDING NEW ITEMS TO THE BLOG SECION***************

STEP 1 ------------------------------------------------------

For this step, you're going to need to create the new blog page. In order to do this find the file labeled:
    "template.html"
Create an exact copy of this file. Name it whatever you want .html REMEMBER THIS NAME
 After doing this navigate to the copy's 'TEMPLATE INSERT' section
Now continue to replace the "Template Title" with the new title
and go ahead and replace everything encapsled in the <p> </p> elements.
!!!! --- IMPORTANT --- Every <p> element represents a paragraph element. If you'd like to add another paragraph,
    add another <p>...</p> element and add the new paragraph between the '...'.
    Currently, the template is configured to have only two paragraphs.


STEP 2 -------------------------------------------------------

Now you're going to have to add this object into the blogs section. It's ordering will be completely up to you (explained later)
First go ahead and navigate to the file labeled:
    "blog.html"
Now navigate to the BLOG LIST tag. 
Find the <li> </li> element
Now in order to add your element, you can do one of two options --> add it before or add it after

In order to add it before, you're going to want to go ahead and copy the <li> </li> object and place it 
before the current <li> object. 
In order to add it after, go ahead and copy the <li> </li> object and place
it after the current <li> object.

Now you are going to want to do two things:

    First you're going to want to replace the "Template" with the desired name of the blog
    Second you're going to want to link the 'href' property to it, so find the href= and change the name from
    "template.html" to whatever your new file's name is

    ****DO NOT PUT YOUR BLOGS IN A NEW FOLDER, THIS WILL INVALIDATE ALL THE LINKS. PLEASE KEEP THEM IN THE MAIN DRIVE****

    Now that you've changed the name, and linked it to your new file name. It should work perfectly!

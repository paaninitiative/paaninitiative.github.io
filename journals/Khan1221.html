		<h2>Water Crisis in Pakista</h2>
        <hr class="colored">
        <!-- Replace this with the information of the blog-->
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sikander Khan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Justification</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pakistan has generally been affected by metallic materials in the water. The arsenic that has contaminated the groundwater across Pakistan poses a serious threat to everyday life in a plethora of regions throughout the nation. Between 25%-30% of all people admitted to hospitals in Pakistan are admitted as a result of water bacterial and parasitic influenced conditions.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The source of the arsenic in the groundwater can stem from a multitude of different variables, but for Pakistan it likely roots from agricultural pollution.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The water crisis has been described by Prime Minister Imran Khan as &ldquo;the biggest challenge confronting the country.&rdquo;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Action needs to be taken to limit exposures and balance the water supply.</span></p>
<p><strong>Objectives</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My objectives for this study are to understand the effects of the exposure of the groundwater on the people of Pakistan and what influences a population&rsquo;s sanitation practices such as waste deposition has with groundwater contamination. This study will help to identify some solutions that can be implemented to help combat negative health outcomes from this evidence.</span></p>
<p><strong>Methodology to Identify Study Population</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the entire nation being victims of the water crisis, I would isolate my study to focus on people who are citizens of Karachi, the most populous city in Pakistan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karachi is similar to being a &ldquo;New York City&rdquo; of Pakistan, as it is made up of individuals of polarizing socioeconomic statuses, resources, and backgrounds. I would focus my study on two separate areas in Karachi - a Population A which is composed of people who have greater access to bottled/clean water and healthier food, and Population B composed of a rural community including individuals such as child laborers, who rely on groundwater and agriculture. From several conversations I have had with international Pakistani students, access to healthy water is heavily associated with socioeconomic status, where lower-income individuals are more prone to being exposed to arsenic. Given this, I will likely utilize an affluent community of individuals for Population A, and an impoverished group for Population B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is not anything similar to a National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in Pakistan. Thus, medical records will be my primary source of information for Population A and influence the design of my study. Those documentations will be useful to understanding the health-related byproducts of drinking healthier water. If there are little discrepancies between expectations, I will move on to structuring a cohort study. I will collect data about the health of members of both populations in spurts, and then monitor it over a few years. This data will consist of information I gather from methods I use to assess exposure.</span></p>
<p><strong>Methodology to Assess Specific Exposure</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The route of exposure to arsenic is generally through the gastrointestinal tract.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">4</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> People in Pakistan generally come into contact with the hazard as a result of drinking it through water or from eating something which has previously come into contact with it such as a fish. The hazard, specifically is a multi-organ system toxin that impacts the skin, lungs, central &amp; peripheral nervous system, GI tract, liver, kidneys and bladder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing I would do is conduct questionnaires and interviews to both Populations A and B. The goal of these interviews would be to identify what are the primary avenues from which these populations are consuming water and food, what type of foods they are eating, and how they dispose of waste. These may be challenging due to communication barriers, since some low-income populations in Pakistan do not even know how to speak, or carry a native tongue that is not known by many. After conducting this test, I will focus on measuring specific exposure amounts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The methodology I suggest to be utilized to assess the specific exposures is through comprehensive sampling through biomarkers. This can be done by measuring arsenic levels in blood, hair, nails, and urine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">5</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For this study, I believe urine should be used as the primary method because absorbed arsenic is typically excreted within urine, and has a half life of only four days. Blood tests are only effective for arsenic when you are exposed at very high levels, so it is not effective for this particular study. Hair and nails are an excellent biomarker for this study, because they will be useful in helping understanding past exposures, and can be quickly connected with questionnaires to analyze trends and patterns that exist between exposures and experiences. By conducting these biomarker exams, we will be able to understand whether or not the exposure is influenced by location and environment, and if environmental justice is a factor.</span></p>
<p><strong>Methodology to Assess Health Outcome of Interest</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The health outcomes from arsenic exposure have been well documented as it is a toxin that is prominent in many different areas. In the short-term, exposure to arsenic-filled water can cause symptoms such as cramps, skin diseases, numbness, and sensory issues.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">6</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We can go about best measuring this through conducting blood tests, to see if either population has experienced this. However, this information is not relevant since we will not be drinking the water for our study.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the long-term, heavy exposure to arsenic can lead to severely troublesome health issues such as cancer, skin lesions, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">7</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> These are serious health concerns that can be tested through very basic levels of healthcare. Unfortunately, one of the biggest issues with health in Pakistan, is the lack of access and health resources available to rural communities. I would attempt to go about assessing the health outcomes of interest in several ways. I would first try working with doctors who are interested in global humanitarian work to do pro-bono check-ups for child laborers and villagers. This would help me assess if individuals had been exposed to arsenic water by conducting a series of tests. I would conduct a complete blood count test to test glucose levels, blood levels, and cholesterol. This would help understand if there are concerns pertaining to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Next, x-rays would be conducted to test for tumors within the lung. I would consider conducting a biopsy for skin lesions if necessary, but I do not believe that would be the case given how exhaustive the other exams would be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to these check-ups, I would see to it that they were paired with the interviews that were conducted to understand the challenges of these individuals. This would help me map out what causation exists between all the factors. This results from this data will help me create a plan of action to help the people who are suffering from the crisis.</span></p>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The water crisis in Pakistan is the nation&rsquo;s biggest concern, and must be dealt with comprehensively. There are several avenues to change it. Desalination plants, dam construction, and well rebuilding are options to bring cleaner water to the masses and prevent dry outs. However, none of these solutions can really solve the problem that result from the footprint of man, and how decisions to dispose of waste through the water supply or endlessly leave water running is creating this sanitary conundrum. Advocacy and education about sanitation principles is key to changing the outlook of the nation&rsquo;s water issues. This should be done through thought leaders dispersing this information, or a retooling of the education system. &nbsp;I suggest the nation works to make this situation the forefront of its agenda and relay this to its allies in order to prevent and reverse the byproducts of this situation.</span></p>
